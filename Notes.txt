TO DO: 

- errors in extension that don't cause any problems??

    - Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
        - happens when Eclipser popup is opened and the current tab does not have the content.js loaded
        - popup sends a message to tab asking for currentDomain
        
    -? Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.
        - something to do with async 
        - fixed by adding 'return true' in onMessage.eventlistener in content.js

- feature, bug, donation section in settings
    - make a payment/donation page on jacobjelen.com
