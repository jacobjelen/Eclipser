TO DO: 

- errors in extension that don't cause any problems??

- content: 2x DOMContentLoaded listener => remove listener after?

- separate button for "New Filter", not in the top menu
- grey content if Eclipser is Paused


- feature, bug, donation section in settings
    - make a payment/donation page on jacobjelen.com

BUGS:
- domain sending refresh or hardRefresh message to content... check the logic
- Facebook not showing content after search >> check 'feed' selectors
- check that filters on alternative URLs actually work
